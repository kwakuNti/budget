# Budget Allocation Based on Total Monthly Income Fix

## Problem Description

The budget allocation system was calculating percentages based only on the user's primary salary, ignoring additional income sources. This meant that if a user had a salary of ₵1000 and additional income of ₵500, the budget allocation would only consider the ₵1000 salary instead of the total ₵1500 monthly income.

## Solution Implementation

The fix ensures that budget allocations are now calculated based on **total monthly income** (salary + additional income sources that are marked to be included in budget).

### Changes Made

#### 1. Backend Changes (`actions/salary_actions.php`)

**`updateBudgetAllocation()` function:**
- Added calculation of total monthly income (base salary + additional income)
- Updated allocation insertion to use total monthly income
- Enhanced response to include income breakdown

**`savePrimarySalary()` function:**
- Updated auto-budget creation to use total monthly income
- Added calculation of additional income sources

**`getSalaryData()` function:**
- Enhanced response to include income breakdown
- Added total monthly income calculation
- Provided backward compatibility fields

**New helper function:**
- `updateBudgetAllocationForIncomeChange()`: Automatically recalculates budget allocation when income sources are added/removed

#### 2. API Changes (`api/budget_categories.php`)

**Enhanced allocation calculation:**
- Added real-time calculation of total monthly income
- Updated allocation amounts if stored data differs from current income
- Provided income breakdown in response

#### 3. Frontend Changes (`public/js/budget.js`)

**Updated data loading:**
- Modified to use total monthly income from allocation data
- Added fallback logic for backward compatibility

**Enhanced template display:**
- Updated `updateAppliedTemplateDisplay()` to show income breakdown
- Displays base salary and additional income separately when applicable

### Database Schema (No Changes Required)

The solution works within the existing database schema by:
- Storing total monthly income in the `monthly_salary` field of `personal_budget_allocation`
- Using computed columns that automatically recalculate when the base amount changes
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing data

### Data Flow

1. **When setting budget allocation:**
   ```
   Base Salary (from salaries table) 
   + Additional Income (from personal_income_sources where include_in_budget = 1)
   = Total Monthly Income
   ```

2. **Allocation calculation:**
   ```
   Needs Amount = Total Monthly Income × Needs Percentage / 100
   Wants Amount = Total Monthly Income × Wants Percentage / 100
   Savings Amount = Total Monthly Income × Savings Percentage / 100
   ```

3. **Automatic updates:**
   - Adding/removing income sources automatically recalculates allocation
   - Frontend displays real-time breakdown of income sources

### Example

**Before fix:**
- Salary: ₵1000
- Additional Income: ₵500 (freelance)
- Budget allocation based on: ₵1000 only
- 50% for Needs = ₵500

**After fix:**
- Salary: ₵1000
- Additional Income: ₵500 (freelance, included in budget)
- Budget allocation based on: ₵1500 total
- 50% for Needs = ₵750

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Transparent income breakdown**: Users can see how their total monthly income is calculated
2. **Automatic updates**: Budget allocations update when income sources change
3. **Backward compatibility**: Existing allocations continue to work
4. **Real-time calculations**: API provides up-to-date calculations even if stored data is outdated

### Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Set up income sources:**
   - Add primary salary (e.g., ₵1000)
   - Add additional income source with "Include in Budget" checked (e.g., ₵500)

2. **Create budget allocation:**
   - Go to Budget page
   - Apply a template (e.g., 50/30/20)
   - Verify allocation is based on ₵1500 (not ₵1000)

3. **Verify breakdown:**
   - Check that the template banner shows income breakdown
   - Confirm individual category allocations are calculated correctly

4. **Test dynamic updates:**
   - Add another income source
   - Verify allocation updates automatically
   - Remove income source and confirm allocation adjusts

### Migration Notes

- **No database migration required**
- **Existing data is preserved**
- **Backward compatibility maintained**
- **Real-time recalculation for all users**

The fix ensures that budget planning reflects users' complete financial picture, making the budget allocations more accurate and useful for financial planning.
